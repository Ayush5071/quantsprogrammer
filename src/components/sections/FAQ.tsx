    question: "What is Dev Roadmap and how does it work?",
    answer:
      "Dev Roadmap is a comprehensive platform that combines structured learning roadmaps, AI-powered mock interviews, blog publishing, and progress tracking. You follow expert-crafted roadmaps, practice interviews with AI feedback, write technical blogs, and earn certificatesâ€”all in one integrated platform designed to accelerate your developer journey.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Dev Roadmap free to use?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All core features including roadmaps, AI interviews, progress tracking, and certificates are completely free. You just need to create an account to access personalized features, track your progress, and start earning certificates immediately.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do the AI mock interviews work?",
    answer:
      "Our AI interviews use Google's Gemini AI to provide realistic interview experiences with voice and text capabilities. You can answer questions via typing or voice input, get instant detailed feedback with scoring, and track your performance over time. The AI adapts questions based on your roadmap progress and skill level.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I earn real certificates from completing roadmaps?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely! Upon completing any roadmap, you'll receive a beautiful, shareable digital certificate generated using Canvas API. These certificates include your name, completion date, roadmap details, and can be downloaded in high resolution or shared directly to LinkedIn, resume, or portfolio.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do I publish blogs on the platform?",
    answer:
      "First, request blog publishing access from your profile dashboard. Once approved by an admin (usually within 24 hours), you can write and publish technical blogs using our rich text editor similar to Medium. This helps build your developer brand and showcase your expertise to the community.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are Top Interviews and leaderboards?",
    answer:
      "Top Interviews are curated, challenging interview questions created by admins that feature competitive leaderboards. Unlike mock interviews focused on practice, these are designed for competition where you can rank against other users, showcase your skills, and climb the global leaderboard.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are the roadmaps updated with latest technologies?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Our team of experienced developers regularly updates roadmaps with the latest technologies, best practices, and industry trends. We also incorporate user feedback and ensure content stays relevant to current job market demands and emerging technologies.",
  },
  {
    question: "How comprehensive is the progress tracking?",
    answer:
      "Your profile dashboard provides detailed analytics including completed roadmap tasks with timestamps, interview history with performance scores, published blogs with views, earned certificates, overall learning streaks, and personalized recommendations for improvement.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the certificates for job applications?",
    answer:
      "Yes! Our certificates are designed to be professional and showcase real skill development. Many users add them to their LinkedIn profiles, resumes, and portfolios. While they're not accredited certifications, they demonstrate practical learning and commitment to continuous improvement.",
  },
  {
    question: "What makes Dev Roadmap different from other learning platforms?",
    answer:
      "Dev Roadmap uniquely combines four essential aspects of developer growth: structured learning paths, realistic AI interview practice, professional blog publishing, and comprehensive progress tracking. Most platforms focus on just one area, but we provide a complete ecosystem for career development.",
